    <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    <p>"Can I get you anything else?" David asked. It was a question he asked a hundred times a day and he always received the
    same answer. It had become such an ingrained part of his daily routine that he had to step back and actively think when
    he heard the little girl's reply. Nobody had before answered the question the way that she did, and David didn't know
    how he should respond.</p>
    <p>You know that tingly feeling you get on the back of your neck sometimes? I just got that feeling when talking with her.
    You know I don't believe in sixth senses, but there is something not right with her. I don't know how I know, but I just
    do.</p>

        Samantha wanted to be famous. The problem was that she had never considered all the downsides to actually being famous.
        Had she taken the time to objectively consider these downsides, she would have never agreed to publically sing that
        first song.
